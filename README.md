# Custom CNN from Scratch for Image Classification on CIFAR-10
This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 distinct classes of images. The dataset includes categories such as 'frog', 'truck', 'deer', and more but i took 3 classes. The CNN architecture is implemented without using pre-built deep learning libraries, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the core concepts of CNNs and image classification.
